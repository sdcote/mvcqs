/**
 * This is a collection of classes which describe the current state of the 
 * system including all the features, their versions and meta data describing 
 * their individual state and relationship to other features. 
 * 
 * <p>This allows the system to programmatically discover and represent its 
 * developmental state. Systems can enumerate all its features and the state 
 * (i.e. version) of each feature and allows a system to change its behavior 
 * based on the state if its feature set.</p>
 * 
 * <p>For example, it is possible for a system to display only production 
 * version of its features and hide those features in development from the 
 * user. The system as also make different features available to different 
 * users; allowing developer logins to access features in development and 
 * testing while user logins only have access to production features.</p>
