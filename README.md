Overview
--------
The purpose of this project is to enable the quick creation of a web 
application using the Spring framework.

It was created to address the frequently re-occurring need for a quick and 
simple web service or a platform independent UI to perform some simple task.

Unlike the BOSS project which is a template for back office services, this 
template is intended to provide a front-end service environment with an 
emphasis on HTML via MVC. FEWAT
